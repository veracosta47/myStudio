Hello, I am Vera, welcome to My Studio!

My Studio serves as a personal portfolio representing my journey as a Junior Full Stack Developer.

** :: Projects introduction :: **

** JavaMiniGame **: This project emerged from a collaborative effort during a three-week Java programming assignment. It encompasses a trio of mini-games with features such as keyboard handling, mouse interaction, and a timer.

** Chillin' with Marvin **: Inspired by the iconic character Marvin the Paranoid Android, this Single Page Application (SPA) delves into his world. In light of his mental health concerns, Marvin created an 'emergency box' SPA for exploration. It offers a Joke Teller, Weather Forecaster, Music Player, and Quotes Generator, employing technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and interfacing with various web APIs.
